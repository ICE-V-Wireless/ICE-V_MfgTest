#Firmware
These directories contain ESP32C3 firmware necessary to support the
ICE-V Wireless manufacturing test. This is built with ESP-IDF and should
work with either stable (V4.4.2) or master (V5.0)

Note that you'll need to copy the `credentials_template.h` file to an new
file called `credentials.h` and add your network SSID and password in order
for the WiFi test to work.
